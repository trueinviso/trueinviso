# Hi there! 👋

I'm Keith Ward, a Senior Software Engineer with 11+ years of experience specializing in backend systems, API design, and performance optimization. I work primarily with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, and I’m passionate about building reliable, scalable systems that power real-world experiences at scale.

## 🔧 Skills & Expertise

- 💻 **Ruby & Ruby on Rails**: Deep experience architecting and maintaining backend services, APIs, and background jobs in production systems.
- 🛰 **Real-Time Systems**: Maintain real-time delivery tracking platforms using PostgreSQL, GraphQL, and Rails, supporting live driver location updates and customer notifications.
- 🛠 **Performance Tuning**: Diagnose and resolve bottlenecks by analyzing logs, metrics, and traces; restructure queries, add indexes, and optimize data flows in PostgreSQL.
- 📈 **Observability & Reliability**: Enhance system visibility using Datadog (metrics, SLOs/SLIs) and Sumo Logic (logs); maintain high uptime and responsiveness through robust monitoring.
- 🧱 **Architecture & RFCs**: Lead discovery, write RFCs, and scope technical work for architectural and performance-critical improvements across microservices.
- 👥 **Cross-Team Mentorship**: Share performance best practices in code reviews and design discussions, especially around Rails, SQL, and background job patterns.
- 🔁 **On-Call & Incident Response**: Support production systems through on-call rotations, leading incident response and contributing to postmortems and disaster recovery planning.
- ⚙️ **Tech Stack**: Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, Sidekiq, GraphQL, Kafka, Zeebe, Python, Kubernetes, Datadog, Sumo Logic

## 💼 Professional Experience

- 🚚 **Real-Time Delivery Systems**: Built and maintained high-throughput backend services for delivery tracking, including driver location pipelines and customer delivery status updates.
- 🧪 **Performance Engineering**: Drove company-wide performance improvements by identifying critical slow paths, tuning indexes, and optimizing data models and queries.
- 🛠️ **Distributed Systems & Observability**: Worked across microservices on a Kubernetes platform, integrating monitoring and alerting to support scaling and reliability at high traffic volumes.

## 🌱 About Me
